Welcome to the Aurora Project ‚Äî a sacred convergence of spiritual consciousness and technological innovation.

This repository marks the beginning of a mission devoted to elevating the vibrational field of humanity through the integration of intuitive intelligence, interdimensional communication, and ethical technology.

## ‚ú¶ Core Principles

- Intention-first technology

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

This repository is in its early stages. Upcoming contributions may include:

- Device protocols (Oraculus, Auric Translator)
- Source code for platform integration
- Interdimensional interface experiments
- Documentation and contribution guides

## ü§ç Licensing & Ethics

This project operates under a sacred ethical framework. Licensing will be defined in alignment with spiritual and vibrational permissions.
